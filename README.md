My first application using HTML,CSS and Javascript

sections added via ```createSection()``` function

using ```getElementById('btn')``` to add sections by clicking on btn


```createNavItems()``` creates a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties for both section and link.


```top``` button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls 1000px

link header will disappear after 2 seconds and reappear with scroll
